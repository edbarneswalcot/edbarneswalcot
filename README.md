Hello, I'm Edward! I'm a Data Scientist and Cloud Architect with 8 years of experience in data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. I have a passion for creating insightful solutions to complex business problems through the effective use and analysis of data. 

I'm experienced in Python and SQL, OOP, data analysis, machine learning and data visualisation. My expertise includes optimizing the processing of big data sets and leveraging them for decision making. Most recently, I was the Director of Operations at GR Bath, where I managed a team of five and was responsible for procuring materials and delivering products. 

My passion for data science and cloud architecture has also been shown in my role as Managing Director at Very Educated. During this role I managed an international team of agents, placing international students at the leading universities in the UK. I am also the proud recipient of a British Council certification for excellence. 

I am currently studying Data Science through a bootcamp program with HyperionDev and will obtain my official certification in 2022-2023.
